So simply we can say,

Aggregator Business Model is a network model where the firm collects the information about a particular good/service providers, make the providers their partners, and sell their services under its own brand. Since the aggregator is a brand, it has to provide services which have uniform quality and price. This is done by signing up a contract with the partners.

but remember 

The good/service providers never become aggregator’s employees

    now lets talk about some important points used in aggregator business model
<h3>1. Customers</h3>
The aggregator business model runs on a two-fold customers strategy where the service consumers as well as the goods/service providers act as the customers of the company
<h3>2 Industry </h3>
All the service providers are from the same industry.

Like Airbnb for Hotels, Uber for taxis, Oyo for hotel rooms, etc

<h3>3 Partnership Model</h3>
The good/service providers act as partners to the business.
<h3>4 Brand</h3>
Aggregators spend most of their revenue in building up a brand. Branding is done at every customer touchpoint to have a recall value.

<h3>5 Quality</h3>
you have to make sure that the partners provide you with the standardized quality product/service. you should have teams that make sure quality is maintained.
<h3>6 Contract</h3>
A contract is signed between the aggregator and the goods/service provider where all the terms are cleared.

Terms usually include
<ul>
    <li> Branding Terms.</li>
    <li>The standardized quality required by the aggregator.</li>
    <li>The Commission (Uber Business model)</li>

Aggregators are different from a marketplace (like Amazon, Alibaba, Flipkart, etc.). They provide different services for different but standardised prices
