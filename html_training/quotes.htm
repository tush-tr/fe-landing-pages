        <p>We’ve gone from having 21 elements in HTML tags, that first document, to having 100 more elements now, and

            years ago. It’s grown an extra 100 elements in there, and yet it’s still the same language.</p>

    <p>HTML has evolved over time.</p>

        <p>If you’re familiar at all with computer formats, this is very surprising. If you tried to open a Word
            processing document from the same time as when Tim Berners-Lee was creating the World Wide Web project, good
            luck. You’d probably have to run some emulation just to get the thing open. And yet you could open an HTML
            document from back then in a browser today.</p>

    <p>The original HTML will work just fine in today's browsers. And today's HTML will be accepted by early browsers. A
        few things might render differently, but the page will still render.</p>
