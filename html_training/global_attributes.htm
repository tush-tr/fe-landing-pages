        <h2 class="subheadline">Beekeeping</h2>
        <p>Humans have kept honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax,
            propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees for
            sale to other beekeepers.</p>
        <p>Depictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years ago; efforts to domesticate them
            are shown in Egyptian art around 4,500 years ago.<sup class="footnote">[91]</sup> Simple hives and smoke
            were used; jars of honey were found in the tombs of pharaohs such as Tutankhamun. From the 18th century,
            European understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb
            hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the colony.</p>

                <p class="byline">by Paul Cameron Brown</p>
                <pre class="poem">
      The taste of an apple,
        the cringing of a bee
      as sun stops turning
        a ladle over their skins;
      the fire gold stains
        on apple's skin,
      the honey yellow, black bits
        a hornet wrinkles in.

                <blockquote class="quote">I’ve said this over and over, but I’ll say it a million more times — I’m
                    concerned more about the death of a bee than I am about terrorism. Because we’re losing hives and
                    bees by the millions because of such strong pesticides.
